        <h1>C∆°m T·∫•m T√†u H·ªß Ky (Broken Rice with Shrimp Paste Wrapped in Bean Curd Skin)</h1>
        <img src="../images/comtam.png" alt="comtam"  style="width:500px;height:500px;">
        <h2>Savory broken rice served with succulent shrimp paste and crispy bean curd skin ü¶ê
        </h2>
            <p>Due to the different size and shape of the grains,
                broken rice has a different, softer texture from "unbroken" rice,
                and absorbs flavours more easily. C∆°m t·∫•m is for everyone. üçö
            </p>
