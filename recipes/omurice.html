            <p>Omurice is considered everyone's favorite childhood dish in Japan.
                It's also one of my favorite recipes because brings me feelings
                nostalgia and comfort that no other dish can. If I make this for you,
                it means I love you. ðŸ˜Š

            <li>6 Tbsp shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>Gather all the ingredients. Spread it out and let it cool completely.</p>
        <h4>To make the Ketchup Fried Rice</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Mince the onion finely into â…›-inch (3 mm) pieces.</li>
                <li>Dice the chicken into Â½-inch (1.3 cm) pieces.</li>
                <li>Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat and sautÃ© the onions until tender.</li>
                <li>Add the chicken and cook until it's no longer pink.</li>
                <li>Add the mixed vegetables and season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Add the cooled rice and use a cutting motion with your spatula to break the clumps into small piecesr</li>
                <li>Add the ketchup and soy sauce and stir to combine. Transfer the fried rice to a plate and wash the pan.</li>
            </ol>
        <h4>To Make the Omuice</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>We'll make the omurice one at a time. Whisk 1 egg and 1 Tbsp milk in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 Tbsp oil in the pan over medium-high heat. Distribute the oil to make sure the surface of the pan is coated well.</li>
            <li>When the pan is hot, pour in the egg mixture and tilt the pan to coat the entire surface with the egg. Cook the egg until the bottom has set but the top is still soft. Lower the heat to medium low.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle 3 Tbsp cheese on top, then add half of the ketchup fried rice across the middle of the omelette.</li>
            <li>Use the spatula to fold both sides of the omelette over the middle to cover the fried rice. Carefully move the omurice to the edge of the pan.</li>
            <li>Holding a plate in one hand and the pan in the other, flip the pan to transfer the omurice, seam side down, onto the plate.</li>
            <li>While it's still hot, cover the omurice with a paper towel and form it with your hands into an elongated oval shape (similar to an American football or rugby ball). Repeat this process to make the next omurice.</li>
            <li>Drizzle additional ketchup in a zigzag pattern on top for decoration and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
