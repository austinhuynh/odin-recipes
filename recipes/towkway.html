        <h4>To make the Chai tow kway</h4> 
            <ol>
                <li>In a non-stick wok or pan, add the oil and place over high heat. When heated up, carefully add cubed carrot cake into the pan. Spread them out and be careful of oil splattering. Leave to cook on one side for 1-2 mins before turning them over to fry the other side.</li>
                <li>When both sides are crisp and golden brown, push the cubes aside with a spatula. Using the spatula, bring the oil to the centre and add garlic and preserved radish. Saute for ½ min and using the spatula, combine with the carrot cake. Drizzle in the soy sauce, fish sauce and sugar and sambal. Mix it thoroughly.</li>
                <li>Arrange the carrot cake in the centre of the pan in one layer. Slowly pour the beaten egg mixture over the entire surface. Use your spatula to gently move the carrot cake so that the egg settles in between the pieces. Leave it for a minute to crisp up.</li>
                <li>Then using the spatula, cut into and flip each carrot cake cube over to cook the other side for ½ min. Flip over again for a few seconds, then flip back. Turn off the heat and transfer to a serving plate. Sprinkle with chopped scallions and serve immediately.</li>
